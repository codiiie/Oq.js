# Oq.js

The idea is inspired by simple sql statements for filtering and selecting desired data.

This makes it easier to filter object-filled arrays to get only the targeted objects from array using "SELECT_FROM" and "UPDATE" with clauses like "WHERE", "AND", "OR" and conditions operators like "=","!=","<",">","<=","=>","LIKE","NOT LIKE".
